<h3>What are workflows?</h3>

<p>A workflow is an abstract model of a series of steps connected to represent a real world process where each
    step defines a specific task or functionality. According to [1], "A program (or script) is to a workflow what
    an unstructured document is to a (structured) database". Workflows are capable of hiding the complexity of the
    execution process. They provide a representation of complex analysis composed of diverse models [2]. A workflow
    is typically authored using a visual front-end or can be hard-coded, and their execution is delegated to a
    workflow execution engine that handles the invocation of the remote applications [3]. Workflow systems can be
    categorized mainly into two sections; business workflows, scientific workflows.</p>

<h3>Business workflows vs. scientific workflows</h3>

<p>Example use cases of scientific workflow: [4]</p>
<ul>
    <li>In astronomy, scientists are using workflows to generate science-grade mosaics of the sky, to examine the structure
        of galaxies, and, in general, to understand the structure of the universe.</li>
    <li>In bioinformatics, researchers are using workflows to understand the underpinnings of complex diseases.</li>
    <li>In physics, workflows are used to search for gravitational waves and model the structure of atoms.</li>
    <li>In ecology, scientists use workflows to explore the issues of biodiversity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    One of the major differences between business and scientific workflows are that, business workflows are control
    flow oriented while scientific processes are data flow oriented. This fact can be explained as follows: a dependency
    in scientific flow "characterizes the data relationship between an input and output of two respective tasks of a scientific
    workflow whereas a dependency characterizes the partial order relation between the executions of two tasks in a business
    workflow."[4]The data flow does not impose an order of execution, it only specifies the input and output of components;
    component B should use component A’s output as input. In scientific workflows a number of tasks can be concurrent but
    not in business workflows. Tasks represented in parallel will mean a conditional choice of one of them.
</p>

<p>Business workflows follow a clear set of rules but scientific workflows involve several different complex computing
    processes and complex data. "To design a robust, fault-tolerance, and adaptive workflow, scientific workflow requires
    modeling of complex control-flow in an essential data-flow oriented environment".[4] Another difference is that scientists
    are concerned about the intermediate steps, results and data of a scientific process while business people are only
    interested in optimizing possible parts of their process to reduce maintenance cost. Therefore "provenance management"
    is identified to be of significant importance in scientific workflow management systems. [4] Scientific workflows
    usually have simple computational models but business workflows have expressive languages (BPEL) to specify complex
    control flow. Scientific workflows are usually based on data intensive tasks. [5] A point related to the above is;
    "Scientific research requires flexible design and exploration capabilities that appear to depart significantly from
    the more prescriptive use of workflows in business" [5]. "Another distinctive issue of scientific workflows is the
    variety and heterogeneity of data within a single workflow."[5]</p>

<h3>Scientific workflows</h3>

<p> We are focused on scientific workflows which are significantly different from the business workflows.
    One of the major differences between business and scientific workflows are that, business workflows are
    control flow oriented while scientific processes are data flow oriented.
    The data flow does not impose an order of execution, it only specifies the input and output of components;
    component B should use component A?s output as input. Three motivations for scientific workflow have been
    identified as follows: [6]
    </p>
<ul>
    <li>Some complex e-science applications often require the creation of a collaborative workflow</li>
    <li>Many e-scientists lack the necessary low-level expertise to utilize the current generation of
        underlying computing infrastructure such as Grid toolkits</li>
    <li>Workflow specifications can be reused, modified and shared once they are defined.</li>
</ul>

<p>With the availability of vast computational power, scientific communities are engaged in solving
    interconnected problems spread over multiple disciplines. These activities have accelerated by
    mapping them onto a workflow. For an example, in earthquake science, workflows are used to predict
    the magnitude of earthquakes within a geographic area over a period of time. Scientific workflow is
    the procedure of combining data and processes into a structured set of steps which can operate as a
    solution to a scientific problem. It includes declarative description about each component and its input
    and output. [1] Workflows can be generated manually by scientists or using third party tools to assist larger
    workflows. They utilize distributed resources in order to access, manage and process large amounts of data
    from a higher-level [7]. Processing and managing such large amounts of data require addressing proper techniques
    for storage facilities and to handle scaling resources.

<h3>Scientific workflow management systems</h3>
<p>
    Both scientific and business workflow management systems provide means to, [4]</p>
<ul>
    <li>Model and specify processes with design primitives</li>
    <li>Re-engineer developed processes such as verification and optimization</li>
    <li>Automating the execution of processes by scheduling, controlling and monitoring the tasks</li>
</ul>
<p>
    Scientific workflow management systems act as a middleware for creating, combining, executing workflows and data
    management tools. They have evolved with the aim of producing a high level platform enabling the end-user scientists
    to create, manage, compose, execute and test scientific workflows without concentrating on the low-level computational
    technology. In the paper [3] scientific workflow management systems are recognized as providing means to; model and
    specify processes with design primitives, re-engineer developed processes such as verification and optimization,
    automating the execution of processes by scheduling, controlling and monitoring the tasks.    </p>
   <p>Before the invention of workflow management systems, programs and scripts were used as means to run scientific
    process with predefined steps. But workflow management systems provide advantages over the earlier mechanism for
    constructing and managing computational tasks. Main advantage is that they provide a simple programming model to
    compose a sequence of tasks simply by connecting the outputs of one task to the inputs of another. An added advantage
    is the intuitive visual programming interfaces of workflow management systems, which make them more suitable for
    users without ample programming expertise. [8]     </p>
   <p> Currently there are many workflow management systems developed targeting various scientific communities such as
    Triana, Pegusas, Taverna and Kepler [9]. Most of these systems are designed to solve problems in certain domains.</p>

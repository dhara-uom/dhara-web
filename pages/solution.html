<h3>Solution Overview</h3>
<p>
    Based on the above analysis we propose a geoscience gateway, which is a collection of geoscience
    related tools and applications that are integrated via a portal, as the solution. The core functions are
    based on an open source software framework: Apache Airavata. Apache Airavataâ€Ÿs capability to
    support execution of complex scientific applications deployed in grid environments and
    supercomputing resources facilitates complex geoscience experiments. Among similar frameworks,
    Apache Airavata is preferred due to its ability to support building web based science gateways and
    the large open source community contribution for it.

    52o North WPS is a major open source WPS standard implementation. WPS implementations
    provide ability for users to expose their own geo processes according to WPS standard. We provide
    WPS orchestration ability for geoscientists with the flexibility to chain a set of WPS processes.
    Services exposed as WPS can be loaded into Apache Airavata which is then used for WPS chaining
    by creating scientific workflows. Further the proposed geoscience gateway facilitates geoscientists to
    create workflows using Apache Airavata and to expose them according to WPS standard. It is
    beneficial for a workflow created in a particular geoscience experiment to be exposed as WPS so that
    it can be reused in another geoscience experiment.

    The proposed solution allows designing and testing workflows in a traditional desktop application
    (i.e. Apache Airavata), and exposing them via standardized WPS interface. This approach also offers
    a convenient way to access workflows and many other data services. It demonstrates the influence of
    WPS orchestration and workflow technologies on geoscience experiments. This minimizes the effort
    of geoscientists in conducting complex experiments. The capabilities provided through the solution
    makes a significant impact in geoscience experiments related to disaster prediction. Effective
    predictions enable policy makers to handle the situations by minimizing damage. Furthermore, the
    user-friendly and convenient environment can be utilized as a learning tool for the students with an
    interest in geoscience to work with simple geoscience experiments.

<h3>OGC’s WCS (Web Coverage Service)</h3>
<p>
    WCS is a OGC standard for define Web-based retrieval of coverage [50] which represents
    digital geospatial information representing space/time-varying phenomena. WCS exposes
    coverage data in convenient forms that are useful in client side rendering and as an input for
    scientific models. One of the major uniqueness of WCS is it allows users to query portion of
    geospatial information in server according to spatial constraints or query criteria.

    “The WCS suite is organized as a Core, which every WCS implementation must support, and a
    set of extensions defining additional functionality”. WCS protocol implementers can choose
    which extensions to support in their implementation. But implementation should include support
    for at least one data encoding format and communication protocol. WCS core establishes a basic
    spatial and temporal extraction. WCS core establishes three requests types which are known as
    GetCapabilities, DescribeCoverage and GetCoverage WCS requests and responses can be make
    via SOAP and REST protocols.

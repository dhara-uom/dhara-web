<h3>Apache Rave</h3>
<p>A web portal is often the front end component of a gateway. It presents the various capabilities of
    gateway in a user-friendly and uniform manner. The portal manages user accounts and users are
    allowed to select and use required capabilities of the gateway. In order to demonstrate a portal for
    our solution, we use Apache Rave.

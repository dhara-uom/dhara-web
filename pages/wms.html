<h3>OGC’s WMS (Web Mapping Service)</h3>
<p>
    OGC‟s WMS (Web Map Service) is a standard protocol for obtaining the geographical map
    images by a map server.Output can be obtained in PNG, GIF, JPEG OR SVG (Scalable Vector
    Graphics), and Web Computer Graphics Metafile (WebCGM) formats. There are basically three
    types of information available; service level metadata, map and features on the map. Three
    operations are handled by WMS spec; GetCapabilities, GetMap, GetFeatureInfo.
    As response for „GetCapabilities‟ operation, client receives services description and request
    parameters accepted via a XML document. In „GetMap‟ request user should specify the format,
    width & height, SRS (Spatial Reference System), Bounding box co-ordinates etc. Height, width,
    Style, format and transparency can also be defined. Map can also be obtained in as layers from
    different WMS servers. The response can even be an exception in the case of standard violation.
    „GetFeatureInfo‟ operation returns a feature on the map if that is enabled on the desired map
    server. Client has to specify the relevant X, Y parameters in the request.

<p>
    WMS is the most widely used standard among WPS, WMS, WCS and WFS. Vast variety of
    clients obtains their map services via this standard. Therefore map servers those who do not
    implement OGC at its core tend to implement WMS converters to increase interoperability.

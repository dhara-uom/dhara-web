<h3>OGCâ€™s WPS (Web Processing Service)</h3>
<p>
    Web Processing Service is one of major standards in OGC. WPS defines standard interface to
    access geospatial processing services. WPS is used to provide wide range of geospatial services
    from simple mathematical calculations to larger geospatial analysis. WPS service discovery and
    execution happens basically in SOA strategies.

<p>
    Basically client can send request to process service with specifying data required. Then user can
    obtain the output by a defined format. Data can be of image data format or GML (Geography
    Markup Language) which is an xml based language.
</p>
<p>
    WPS atomic operations have been standardized to achieve interoperability among processes.
    There are 3 main methods defined in WPS: GetCapabilities, DescribeProcesses and Execute.
    GetCapabilities method provides what processes are available and description of each. For an
    example to calculate an intersection area of two buffered areas, client might expect the intersect
    to be returned.
</p>
<p>
    Client send it as HTTP request with KVP(key/value pair) service as WPS and request as
    GetCapabilities. Then client can identify whether the process desired is available or not in the
    relevant WPS server.
</p>
<p>
    If the desired process is found, client can request more detailed information of that process. That
    is can be achieve through DescribeProcess. This is need of two areas as inputs name firstarea and
    secondarea where output to be named as thirdarea. Basically theree types of input output
    formats are defined: Literal data, Complex data and bounding box data [49]. Literal data can be
    primitive like character, string, date, etc. Complex data is vector or raster data. And the bounding
    box format specifies the area of a map as a box. An XML schema is defined for the co-ordinates.
    Execute will trigger the process to be executed for obtain the output in GML format. Request is
    similar to KVP HTTP GET request where input parameters defined accordingly. If the time
    taken to a process is greater than the time taken for live HTTP connection then client can request
    to use poll method for retrieve output results of a particular process. In poll method client
    frequently poll and see whether the data is available.
</p>
<p>
    Output can be specific MIME schema or reference URL for the result. The output can be
    anything. Even it can be an image where client need to specify for raw data output.
    Requests can also be wrapped using SOAP structure where SOAP body is used to define request
    parameters of WPS. This promotes platform independent, language independent and highly
    extensible messaging framework support for WPS.

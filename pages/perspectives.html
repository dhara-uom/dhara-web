<h2><strong>Architectural Perspectives</strong></h2>

<p>We have come up with two potential architectures for integrating WPS capabilities with Apache&nbsp;Airavata. These perspectives address the limitations of existing systems which are identified through&nbsp;out literature review. The 1st architecture is focused on enabling Apache Airavata to orchestrate&nbsp;WPS processes by importing WSDLs of an existing WPS instances. The 2nd architecture is about&nbsp;deploying a workflow created in Apache Airavata as a WPS which provides a high degree ofreusability for geoscience experiments.</p>

<h3><strong>WPS Orchestration</strong></h3>

<p>WPS orchestration is about providing the flexibility to the chain a set of WPS processes. It is a&nbsp;crucial need for geoscientist to carry out their experiments effectively. Hence, WPS orchestration&nbsp;is a major functionality that should be present in a geoscience gateway. Figure 1 shows the&nbsp;architectural diagram of WPS orchestration using Apache Airavata with the use of SOAP&nbsp;interfaces provided by the existing WPS implementing software. PyWPS WPS implementation is&nbsp;capable of expose WPS services through WSDL which can use to import WPS services as&nbsp;components in XBaya UI thourgh WSDL interface to chain WPS processes. 52 o North WPS&nbsp;implementation is still lacking feature of expose WPS services through WSDLs. But it‟s in the&nbsp;development roadmap of 52o North WPS implementation.</p>

<p><strong><em>Functional flow</em></strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Apache Airavata is capable of importing a WSDL, listing available services of a WPS&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; instance (PyWPS, 52o North WPS), through its XBaya GUI.</li>
    <li>Each service imported through the WSDL is made available as a component which&nbsp;can be used to compose a workflow simply through drag-and-drop in XBaya UI.</li>
    <li>After creating the workflow, Apache Airavata‟s workflow interpreter engine can&nbsp;execute it through SOAP messages consuming the used WPS processes.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Objectives</em></strong></p>

<ul>
    <li>Reusing existing WPS processes in a geoscience application</li>
    <li>Ease of WPS orchestration through scientific workflows</li>
    <li>Use existing WPS processes available in Desktop GIS systems like GRASS from theweb by bridging with WPS implementations</li>
</ul>
<br/>

<h3><strong>Workflows in WPS Standard</strong></h3>

<p>Geoscience experiments are often complex and requires a significant programming knowledge to
    develop sophisticated algorithms and programs for them. Therefore at the current stage of
    computational geoscience, geoscientists are unable to engage in such tasks on their own without
    the aid of a computer scientist. But it would be convenient and beneficial for the geoscientists to
    be able to author a geoscience process on their own.</p>

<p>Complex geoscience computations require HPC resources for executing. General purpose
    computers are not sufficient to carry out these complex computations. Apache Airavata enables
    the support to execute the complex scientific applications deployed in grid environments and
    supercomputing resources. Apache Airavata‟s GFac component wraps command line driven
    scientific applications and make them into network-accessible services which can be used to
    create scientific workflows. A geoscience gateway is a place which abstracts the complex
    computational resources and provides a domain specific environment for scientist to conduct
    their experiments. Therefore architecture 2 addresses a major functionality which needs to be
    present in a geoscience gateway.</p>

<p><em><strong>Functional flow</strong></em></p>

<ul>
    <li>Geoscientist author and test workflows in XBaya UI, making use of the services&nbsp;added by the gateway developer</li>
    <li>Geoscientist deploy the created workflows in the WPS server instance (PyWPS)</li>
    <li>Deployed WPS processes can be queried by any WPS client by sending a&nbsp;&lt;GetCapabilities&gt; request to the server instance. This request will be responded&nbsp;directly by the WPS server itself without communicating with Apache Airavata</li>
    <li>Queries to WPS for process description (&lt;DescribeProcess&gt;) will also be responded&nbsp;directly by the WPS server.</li>
    <li>Execute requests to WPS server (&lt;Execute&gt;) will be forwarded to Apache Airavata,&nbsp;which will only handle the computation. The process output will be then sent to&nbsp;Apache Airavata and forwarded to WPS server accordingly.These steps are explained&nbsp;in Figure 2.</li>
</ul>

<p><em><strong>Objectives</strong></em></p>

<ul>
    <li>Ability to share computations created as workflows by deploying them in a WPS&nbsp;server</li>
    <li>Use the functionalities provided in various geo-processing libraries (GDAL/OGR,Proj4) available via WPS implementations.</li>
    <li>Authoring of processes in WPS standard which is now in the hands of the software&nbsp;developer can be made</li>
</ul>

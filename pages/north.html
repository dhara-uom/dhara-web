<h3>52 North WPS</h3>
<p>
    52o North WPS is an open source WPS implementation completely based on Java. It supports all
    features and operations of WPS specification version 1.0.0 [53]. Itâ€Ÿs focused on the creation of an
    extensible framework to provide algorithms for generalization on the web. 52 o North WPS
    provides SOAP support for WPS invocation. And it also supports synchronous and asynchronous
    processing. There are several in-built processes such as,
    <ul>
    <li>ConvexHullAlgorithm</li>
    <li>IntersectsAlgorithm</li>
    <li>DouglasPeuckerAlgorithm</li>
    <li>SimpleBufferAlgorithm</li>
    <li>Custom process can also be developed and hosted on server where client will be able to know
    about the processes deployed with the GetCapabilities request.</li>
    </ul>

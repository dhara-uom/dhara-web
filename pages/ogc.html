<h3>OGC</h3>
<p>
    OGC (Open Geospatial Consortium) is not for profit organization which makes geospatial standards.
    Objective of OGC is to “a world in which everyone benefits from the use of geospatial information
    and supporting technology”. At the time of writing this, OGC is consisted of 445 companies,
    research organizations, public organizations, and universities getting together developing interface
    standards to make almost all geospatial applications interoperable by going through a consensus
    process. Set of OGC standards are so large and no single software in the world has implemented
    almost all the standards. To give an overview, some of the standards will be discussed here.
    OGC standards expand in many domains. For an example in aeronautics Aeronautical Information
    Exchange Model (AIXM) and the Weather Information Exchange Model (WXXM) standards are
    based on OGC [1]. Spatial data for built environment for civil engineering aspects is also a major
    usage where 3d modeling is heavily used. Geographical location finding is heavily used in business
    intelligence systems where lot of applications needs to be interoperable and common standard is a
    must. In defense systems OGC standards are used because of no proprietary system can provide such
    a broad range of interoperability cost effectively. Disaster management systems also use different
    kind of raster data, vector data and route data where many systems needs to be interoperable (not
    only IP based). Similarly it has a broader scope in many other fields as well.

    These software may be OGC implementing or OGC compliant. Only OGC compliant products can
    wear official OGC logo. For a product or a software to become OGC compliant it needs to pass
    CITEE tests [2]. CITE tests are essentially about Web Services.
</p>
<p>
    OGC has number of standards spread in disciplines as mentioned above. From the web services point
    of view we can find WMS (Web Map Service), WFS (Web Feature Service), WPS(Web Processing
    Service) and (WCS)Web Coverage Service. WMS basically focus on providing the relevant map.
    Client can request the specific map by addressing the relevant URL with standard defined parameters
    with coordinates. Then map is returned in PNG, GIF or JPEG, or sometimes as vector-based
    graphical elements in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) or Web Computer Graphics Metafile
    (WebCGM) formats.
</p>
<p>
    WFS provides features over a map. After obtaining the map, client might need to show specific
    geographical features on top of a map. For an example it may be locations where some wild fire
    occurs. WMS server cannot provide that. And it should be obtained as a feature. This data is received
    by (Geographical Markup Language) GML format. Then those specific locations can be displayed by
    client software.
</p>
<p>
    WPS is specified for geospatial processing. For an example in the above scenario if some client
    needs to identify which towns are affected by wildfire he has to call Web Processing service which
    can calculate the buffer area, impact on intersections .etc. So client can then display the towns
    affected by the wild fire. WPS can be used to provide even the simplest calculation and very
    sophisticated calculations.
</p>
<p>
    WCS is more related to space/time phenomena. Not like WMS and WFS providing static So this
    dynamic information can be used for client side rendering and use more rich set of syntaxes than
    WMS and WFS.
</p>
<p>
    Likewise OGC standards are in wider range and they are widely adopted by larger community. And
    it is continuously evolving until almost everybody gets benefit out of it. Error! Reference source

<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>
    Dhara is a geoscience gateway which enables geoscientists to perform their experiments without
    understanding underlying complex high performance computational resources. Apache Airavata
    which is a scientific workflow management system and OGC's geoscience standards are extensively
    used in the Dhara project. Dhara provides the capability of creating workflows using available WPS
    services. Geoscientists create workflows as part of their experiments and Dhara is capable of
    providing support to deploy developed geoscience workflow as a WPS services in WPS
    implementations. Deploying workflows created in Apache Airavata as a WPS services enable high
    degree of reusability of geoscience workflows which can be used by other geoscientists in their
    experiments. End users interact with Dhara portal which provides a simplified interfaces for users
    along with numerous geoscience services which powered by Apache Rave science gateway building
    framework.

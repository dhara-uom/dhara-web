<h3>OGC’s WFS (Web Feature Service)</h3>
<p>
    The Open Geospatial Consortium Web Feature Service Interface Standard (WFS) provides an interface
    allowing requests for geographical features across the web using platform-independent calls.
    One can think of geographical features as the "source code" behind a map, whereas the WMS interface or online
    mapping portals like Google Maps return only an image, which end-users cannot edit or spatially analyze.
    The XML-based GML furnishes the default payload-encoding for transporting the geographic features,
    but other formats like shapefiles can also serve for transport. In early 2006, the OGC members approved the
    OpenGIS GML Simple Features Profile. This profile is designed to both increase interoperability between WFS servers and
    to improve the ease of implementation of the WFS standard[1].
